- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @darrincassidy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music production, hiking, gardening, wood-work, and classic American literature, and computers of course.
- ðŸŒ± I love writing programs in Java and I love working with databases. I also like learning and could spend all my free time immersing myself into new languages, frameworks, and the coding techniques of those far more experienced than me.
